DVD Title Logger
---

This is a small application that logs the titles of a DVD as you traverse them
by navigating the menu.

Uses:
- PySimpleGUI
- VLC
- dvd_info


The VLC embed does not work properly on my Mac, I instead run it within a
Debian VM.

I am posting this publicly in case it is useful to anyone else, but mostly to
save my work. I do not consider this to be indicative of my professional work,
this is just something I whipped together to make a repetitive task quicker.
